Create a local file :

```
cd ~/demo
touch SURPRISE_DUDE
```{{execute}}

```
lftp -d -u rasta,didi -p 21 127.0.0.1:21
put SURPRISE_DUDE
ls
exit
```{{execute}}

You've just uploaded the file `SURPRISE_DUDE` to the remote `root` dir of the Ftp server.

At this stage you have dealed with interactive shell, now assume you want to do the same operations from script for automation process.

Let's cleanup our demo directory :

```
cd ~/demo
rm -rf *
clear
ls
```{{execute}}
