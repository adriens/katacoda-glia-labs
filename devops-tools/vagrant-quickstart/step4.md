Now that you have initialized your project and configured a box for
it to use, it is time to boot your first Vagrant environment.

Bring up a virtual machine by running the following command :

```
vagrant up
```{{execute}}

Within a very short amount of time, this command will finish and you will have a
fully fonctional virtual machine running the Ubuntu you requested.


```
vagrant ssh
```{{execute}}

Pay attention to welcome messages, you are logged into your brand new virtual machine.
