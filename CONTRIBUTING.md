# How to become a contributor

So you want to contribute. That's great, let's just follow some guidelines to keep the process smooth.

## Issues

To keep things in order, everything comes as an issue, so please take a look at our [issue templates](https://github.com/adriens/katacoda-glia-labs/issues/new/choose).

## Creation process

1. Fill a dedicated issue template with your idea (be concise and explain what are the expected gains)
2. Development process by a dedicated developer
3. Scenario review by an another developer
4. Loop(s) between developer and reviewer
5. Demo to a customer that has never used the scenario
6. Demo to an another new customer that has never used the scenario
7. Scenario official release

## Release a new scenario or course

As part of the release process, be sure to :

- [x] Ask @adriens to create a short url that targets your course/scenario
- [x] Create a QrCode on [Qr Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) that uses the previous short url **and** puts the proper logo :

## Examples

# Live demo

When making a live demo, be sure to prepare a short slideshow (RevealJS or powerpoint) that :

- [x] Presents the topic we are working on
- [x] Why we have developed this content
- [x] What they will discover during the session
- [x] Details the expected benefits
- [x] Provides the short url on a dedicated slide
- [x] Provides the QrCode on a dedicated slide so people with phones and tablets can flash it
